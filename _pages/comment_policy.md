We want you to enjoy your stay here as much as possible and to do so, please abide by these guidelines:

#### Don't be a jerk.
We will not tolerate any name-calling, personal attacks or harassment of any kind. Racism, bigotry, misogyny or any other inappropriate responses will be removed.

#### Absolutely NO drama!
Do not bring drama from a different channel onto this one. Personal attacks against a mod will not be tolerated. Do not pursue an argument with a mod from another channel they mod to this one.

#### Stay on topic. 
If your post does not address the article or relate to it in some context, you will be asked to take your conversation to the Coffee Lounge and your post deleted.

#### No trolling 
If you post a deliberately offensive or provocative comment with the aim of upsetting someone or eliciting an angry response from them, your post will be deleted. Continue the behavior and you'll be asked to leave.

#### No stalking
If you follow someone to this channel to continue an argument you've had with them on another or to harass them, your post will be deleted. Continue the behavior and you will be asked to leave.

#### No sock puppets 
If you try to circumvent a ban by returning with a sock puppet or new account, you will earn an instant ban; no warning needed.

#### No serial flagging
Flagging is to be done only if the commenter has violated the Disqus Terms of Service, contains spam or offensive language. Flagging simply because you don't agree with someone is unacceptable.
