## Things I use and Recommend

### Pen
This is the important assets for any person as per me. Without a my pen I fell useless. I keep it with me everywhere I go. I use Cello Gripper. It is one of the oldest company producing pens. Cello company was established in year 1995 which was later bought by BIC.

### Biology Book
I love this book, ofcourse after NCERT. It summarize the whole NCERT in one book. Awesome book to study for CBSE Boards and NEET exams. This book is helped me to revise but this book is no substitute for NCERT.
