The thyroid is a vital gland. It plays a very important role in metabolism, growth and development of the body. It is responsible for producing three main hormones Triiodothyronine (also known as T3), Tetraiodothyronine (also called thyroxine or T4) and Calcitonin. The thyroid is located below Adam’s apple along the front of the windpipe. Thyroid has two sides connected by the bridge also known as the isthmus.
Various diseases can be caused due to an issue with the thyroid gland. But we will mainly focus on Hypothyroidism.

## What is hypothyroidism?
Hypothyroidism stands for *hypo* = meaning low and *thyroidism* = production of thyroid hormone. In this disorder, the thyroid gland produces less than the required amount of thyroid hormone. This causes various problems, some are gender-neutral and some are gender-specific. We will talk about the cause later on but first, let’s see the symptoms of hypothyroidism.

## Causes of Hypothyroidism
We all know “precaution is better than cure” still we keep falling prey to laziness in taking care of our health.
### Iodine Deficiency
Iodine deficiency is the most common cause of hypothyroidism. This can be easily mitigated by taking enough iodine in the diet.
The most common way to ensure this is to take iodised salts. These are regular table salts which have iodine already added to them. So whenever you consume this salt you ensure proper intake of iodine.
You can also complete your iodine deficiency using iodine tablets like this.



### Swelling of Thyroid
Another most common reason for hypothyroidism is inflammation of the thyroid gland. Due to inflammation thyroid can’t produce enough hormones and this causes Hashimoto's Thyroiditis or autoimmune thyroiditis.

### Radiation Therapy
Sometimes radiation therapy leads to the destruction of thyroid cells, which are then not able to produce hormone and results in hypothyroidism
Thyroid Surgery 
Often removing a large part of the thyroid gland after the surgery leads to hypothyroidism and requires the patient to take supplements.

### After Giving Birth
After women give birth, about 5% develop postpartum thyroiditis which can occur up to nine months afterwards.

### Pituitary Disorder
Very rarely, the pituitary gland does not produce enough Thyroid Simulating Hormone (TSH), with lead to lower production of hormones causing hypothyroidism.

## Symptoms of Hypothyroidism
