In the year 2013, the Indian Government revolutionized the corporate sector in India. New regulations were introduced using The Company Act of 2013. This Act introduced the concept of one person company. Earlier, to start a company the entrepreneurs had to go through and follow tough regulations, it was more time-consuming. This used to consume a lot of time. Entrepreneurs used to less time making products and doing things which mattered and lots of time in complying.

To make matters worse the entrepreneurs need to have more than one directors and hold meetings e.t.c. These all made starting a company very difficult. To promote entrepreneurship and give advantage to startups, the Indian Government introduced the one person company.  Some countries have already introduced this act such as China, the United Kingdom e.t.c. Let's look deeper into the one person company.

## What is One Person Company?
One person company is defined in Sub-Section 2 of section(2) of The Companies Act of 2013, which reads as follow:-
> One Person Company means a company which has only one member

It shall also be important to note that Section 3 classifies (One Person Company)OPC as Private Company for all the legal purpose with only one member. All the provisions related to the private company apply to a (One Person Company)OPC, unless otherwise expressly excluded.

## What are the advantages of One Person Company?

#### 1. Limited Liability
Just like Public Limited Company or Private Limited Company, the most important feature of One Person Company is that the risk in starting the business is limited to the amount invested in the business. This is helpful since you know you can't lose more than you have invested in the business. It gives entrepreneurs more flexibility in doing their work and taking risks.

#### 2. Separate Legal Entity
It is clearly stated that One Person Company can function as a separate legal entity. It has its recognition. It has rights over its assets. No member has the insurable right in the assets of the company.

#### 3. Transferability of Shares
Share of One Person Company only belongs to one person, meaning there can't be more than one shareholder. If the share is transferred then the 100% shares are transferred. No partial transfer of shares is allowed in One Person Company. This removes the risk of losing control over the company.

#### 4. Tax Relaxations
As One Person Company is a separate legal entity, it is allowed to hold contracts with directors and other members. Meaning the amount paid to the director as remuneration can be deducted from the profit, also it can pay rent which will further reduce the profit and leading to less tax. The Indian Governments is running various schemes to promote OPC, a scheme such as **Startup India** help new companies.
