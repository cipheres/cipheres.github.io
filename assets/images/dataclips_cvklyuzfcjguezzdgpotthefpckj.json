But let's see how these organisms are able to pull the trick of lighting. Bioluminescence is shown by mostly deep sea creatures. There're certain creatures that live above the ocean floor(Firefly). There is almost no fresh water organism that lights up.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eHumans have developed flashlight, torches, and whatnot to get light when required but Deep sea creatures don't have this liberty. Deep-sea creatures have bioluminescence because they need to navigate or attract prey. There certain instances where they use bioluminescence to attract their partners.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eLights can be generated using luminescence and incandescence. Incandescence is a method of light generation using heat. This method is used by in our bulb and day to day life. This form of light generates a lot of heat and this wastes energy. This method of light generation is inefficient.\r\nWhereas nature uses luminescence, this method produces what we call cold light as only 20% of light emitted generates heat.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cfigure class=\"figure\"\u003e\r\n  \u003cimg src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/storage-texoviva/img/Filament_incandecent.jpg\" class=\"figure-img img-fluid rounded\" alt=\"Filament of the light bulb\"\u003e\r\n  \u003cfigcaption class=\"figure-caption\"\u003eFilament of light bulb which produce light by incandescence\u003c/figcaption\u003e\r\n\u003c/figure\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eAlmost all the light generated is due to chemical reactions. While every organism uses a different chemical to generate heat but two chemicals luciferin and ether luciferase are mostly used. Scientists still don't how most of the organisms create a light but from what we know most of them use chemicals mentioned above.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eLuciferin is a substrate \u0026 Luciferase is an enzyme. If you don't know what substrate is? Then think of substrate as something on which enzymes work and the chemical reaction happens. The colors which come out are results of arrangements of a molecule of Luciferin.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cfigure class=\"figure\"\u003e\r\n  \u003cimg src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/storage-texoviva/img/Enzyme-substrate_binding.png\" class=\"figure-img img-fluid rounded\" alt=\"Filament of the light bulb\"\u003e\r\n  \u003cfigcaption class=\"figure-caption\"\u003eFilament of light bulb which produce light by incandescence\u003c/figcaption\u003e\r\n\u003c/figure\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eSome organisms synthesize luciferin on their own but others acquire it from other animals.

Many of them exist in a place where humans can't even thrive for a second.\u003c\r\nIn this post, you will top 5 of these organisms and where they are found. Without further ado, let's start\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cfigure class=\"figure\"\u003e\r\n  \u003cimg src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/storage-texoviva/img/firefly.jpg\" class=\"figure-img img-fluid rounded\" alt=\"FireFly\"\u003e\r\n  \u003cfigcaption class=\"figure-caption\"\u003eFireFly\u003c/figcaption\u003e\r\n\u003c/figure\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003col\u003e\r\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ch3\u003e Firefly \u003c/h3\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\r\nMust have heard about this fly. Whenever most people see this name the first thing that comes in their mind is fireflies flying on a dark, beautiful night, enjoying inside a tent camp. What many people don't know is that each firefly has its own flash pattern.  It flies through the flashing its own flash pattern to find mates during twilight. \r\nBut don't get influenced by the beauty they are equally dangerous. They light up because of the chemical reaction which I talk more about \u003ca\u003e here.  They not only taste nasty but they have a natural \u003ca\u003emethod of defending from prey. When some predator attacks, fireflies kick in a process called 'reflex bleeding'. During this process, they release blood which contains bitter tasting chemical which is poisonous for vertebrates and sometimes for humans too.\r\n\r\n\u003cfigure class=\"figure\"\u003e\r\n  \u003cimg src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/storage-texoviva/img/Aequorea+victoria.jpg\" class=\"figure-img img-fluid rounded\" alt=\"Aequorea victoria\"\u003e\r\n  \u003cfigcaption class=\"figure-caption\"\u003eAequorea victoria\u003c/figcaption\u003e\r\n\u003c/figure\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ch3\u003e Aequorea victoria\u003c/h3\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\r\nI bet most of have never heard of this creature or maybe you would have in some movie or picture. The reason is that they are found in very specific places. They are only found on the west coast of North America. They can be found swimming on the shoreline of southern California.\r\n You will able to notice them usually at night. You don't have worry about jellyfish sting, they have tentacles with nematodes(sting) to capture the prey these are pretty much useless to humans. Most people don't even realize that they have been stung by Aequorea victoria.\r\n\r\n\u003cfigure class=\"figure\"\u003e\r\n  \u003cimg src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/storage-texoviva/img/firefly_squid.jpg\" class=\"figure-img img-fluid rounded\" alt=\"firefly squid\"\u003e\r\n  \u003cfigcaption class=\"figure-caption\"\u003eFireFly Squid\u003c/figcaption\u003e\r\n\u003c/figure\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cli\u003e \u003ch3\u003eFirefly Squid \u003c/h3\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\r\nYa, you heard it right a squid that lights up. Many of us won't be able to see it in our lifetime. They are found the Western Pacific Ocean. But that is not the reason, the reason is that they live 183 meters or 600 feet below the surface of the ocean. They only come up during the night time.\r\nThat doesn't stop us from learning about this creature. They have amazing ability to camouflage, when they are on the surface they match with the light coming under their body making them transparent to predators.\r\nThey light up like Firefly, and when some small fish comes up to the surface, they have their meal.\r\nThey are pretty small in size, they are only 3 inches or 7.6cm at maturity and dies after one year of life.\r\n\r\n\u003cfigure class=\"figure\"\u003e\r\n  \u003cimg src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/storage-texoviva/img/Aequorea+victoria.jpg\" class=\"figure-img img-fluid rounded\" alt=\"firefly squid\"\u003e\r\n  \u003cfigcaption class=\"figure-caption\"\u003eFireFly Squid\u003c/figcaption\u003e\r\n\u003c/figure\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cli\u003e \u003ch3\u003eSea Sparkle\u003c/h3\u003e \u003c/li\u003e\r\nWell, Sea Sparkle is not a scientific but funny name, the scientific name of this creature is Noctiluca Scintillans, for the sake I call it Sea Sparkle.\r\nThey are available in abundance inside the fresh water, these are not fish this Dinoflagellate (like marine plankton).\r\nInitially, they are invisible but show it's luminescence when disturbed.\r\nThese are widely found throughout the world, often alongside the coast and shallow waters.\r\n\r\n\u003cfigure class=\"figure\"\u003e\r\n  \u003cimg src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/storage-texoviva/img/angler_fish.jpg\" class=\"figure-img img-fluid rounded\" alt=\"Angler Fish\"\u003e\r\n  \u003cfigcaption class=\"figure-caption\"\u003eAngler Fish\u003c/figcaption\u003e\r\n\u003c/figure\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ch3\u003eAngler Fish\u003c/h3\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\r\nWell, most of you were waiting for this creature. No list of bioluminescence is complete without it. Anglerfish are extreme sexual dimorphism meaning that male looks completely different from the female, females are much larger than male, well there are no feminists in angular fish. They use luminescence to capture the prey. \r\nThey are available in a wide range of colors from dark grey to dark brown, like other these deep sea creatures have very large heads and enormous mouth. They are almost impossible to find by a normal human, they live 1400 feet below the water surface. They swim at a very poor speed of 2.4 cm per second. \r\nThey have a very unusual method of mating, mating is also not very common for them as the swimming rate is so slow, their encounter with a partner is very rare.\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI hope you enjoyed reading as much as I enjoyed presenting it.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","2019-05-03 12:31:14+00","2019-05-03 12:31:14+00","Bioluminescence, Organism",1,2,"https://s3.amazonaws.com/storage-texoviva/img/bioluminescence_refrence.jpg","organisms-that-light-up-fYqBx","Organisms that light up, In this post, you will top 5 of these organisms and where they are found.
